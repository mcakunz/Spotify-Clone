I'm starting this repo by building a **Spotify clone**, following the tutorial by **Code With Antonio**:

> Big credits to Code With Antonio — this project is based on his video. I'm just following along to learn.

## Why I'm doing this
Main goal: get comfortable with these tools and understand how they work together:

- Next.js  
- React  
- Supabase  
- PostgreSQL  
- Tailwind CSS
